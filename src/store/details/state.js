I was really inspired because I felt like I could actually bring some improvement to the education system in our country and let children have actual digital textbooks, not just some PDFs with some screenshots. These were interactive textbooks, easy to understand and use for both teachers and students, which gave feedback. I used SCSS for the first time and fell in love with it ever since; also I discovered Pug, which I would gladly use instead of plain HTML. After this, I improved my code writing and my knowledge about frameworks and how they work."
